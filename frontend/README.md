    the base branch (usually main(master)).

    ```

    ```

- Try to commit in reference to the module and the story.

  - `[MODULE][CLICKUP-TICKET-ID]: Comment`
    And then close ClickUp ticket from the portal once code is merged

- Don't commit directly to main(master)/staging/develop branches.
